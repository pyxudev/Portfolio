    If you don't move, after 10 seconds lock screen will be shown.
    <br />
    After 15 seconds after document ready, a warning will appear asking if user wants to renew a session.
    <br />
    If the user doesn't want to, then after 5 more seconds he will be redirected to login page.
    <br />
    <br />
    Note: The code is for demo purposes, you can configure it like you want to.
    If you don't want a session timeout you can just make a keep alive call from time to time. :)
    <br />
    You can find more information looking at source code or at our extensive documentation.
